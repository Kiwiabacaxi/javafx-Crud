# JavaFX CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with JavaFX. It's designed as a quick-start template for JavaFX projects.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete operations for records.
- A "user-friendly" interface built with JavaFX (though things might look a bit crooked and it's not exactly responsive!).
- Database connectivity for data persistence.
- A special "Orbolato Speedrun Mode" - for those who just want to grab the project and go!

## Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or later
- JavaFX SDK
- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Notepad or Powerpoint)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Kiwiabacaxi/javafx-Crud.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Configure your IDE to use the JavaFX SDK.
4. Run the application.

## Usage

- Use the form to add new records.
- Select a record from the table to update or delete it.
